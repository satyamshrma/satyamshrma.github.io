			<h2> Covid-19 Detection using Pytorch and gradio UI</h2>
			<p> With the help my professors, I have developed a model which
			    is used to detect covid by check patients chest x-ray
			    this model was prepared using some famous libraries of 
			    python such as os shutil,random,torch,torchvision,numpy </p>

			<h2> Disease prediction using PYTHON</h2>
			<p> In this model,I have created two separate module which 
			    contains set of symptoms of around 25 disease and other
			    module contains predicted message .
			    in the main program , if we enter three symptoms then 
			    the program checks for subset in various diease 's symptom
                            set. This model uses Gradio based UI to Enter the symptoms</p>
